What are some automated tools and approaches for optimizing prompts in AI systems?,"Tools that aim to automate the whole prompt engineering workflow include Open Prompt (Ding et al., 2021) and DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023). At a high level, you spec ify the input and output formats, evaluation metrics, and evaluation data for your task. These prompt optimization tools automatically find a prompt or a chain of prompts that maximizes the evaluation metrics on the evaluation data. Functionally, these tools are similar to autoML (automated ML) tools that automatically find the optimal hyperparameters for classical ML models. A common approach to automating prompt generation is to use AI models. AI mod els themselves are capable of writing prompts.10 In its simplest form, you can ask a model to generate a prompt for your application, such as “Help me write a concise prompt for an application that grades college essays between 1 and 5”. You can also ask AI models to critique and improve your prompts or generate in-context exam ples. Figure 5-7 shows a prompt written by Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024). DeepMind’s Promptbreeder (Fernando et al., 2023) and Stanford’s TextGrad (Yuk sekgonul et al., 2024) are two examples of AI-powered prompt optimization tools. Promptbreeder leverages evolutionary strategy to selectively “breed” prompts. It starts with an initial prompt and uses an AI model to generate mutations to this prompt. The prompt mutation process is guided by a set of mutator prompts. It then generates mutations for the most promising mutation, and so on, until it finds a prompt that satisfies your criteria. Figure 5-8 shows how Promptbreeder works at a high level",aiengineering.pdf 230,"Tools like Open Prompt and DSPy automate prompt engineering by allowing users to specify input/output formats and evaluation metrics. These tools use AI models themselves to generate, critique, and improve prompts. Advanced approaches include Promptbreeder (using evolutionary strategies) and TextGrad, which leverage AI to iteratively optimize prompts for better performance."
How does Tree-of-Thought prompting work in LangChain?," Tree-of-thought
 In Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting, we generate multiple problem-solving steps or approaches 
for a given prompt and then use the AI model to critique them. The critique will be based on the 
model’s judgment of the solution’s suitability to the problem.
 There is actually an implementation now of ToT in the LangChain experimental package; however, 
let’s walk through an instructive step-by-step example of implementing ToT using LangChain.
 First, we’ll define our four chain components with PromptTemplates. We need a solution template, 
an evaluation template, a reasoning template, and a ranking template",generativeaiwithlangchain.pdf page 251,"Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting generates multiple problem-solving steps or approaches for a prompt, then uses the AI model to critique them based on solution suitability. In LangChain, it involves four chain components with PromptTemplates: solution template, evaluation template, reasoning template, and ranking template. This allows exploration of multiple reasoning paths."
What are common use cases for the PanResponder API in React Native?,"Use cases for the PanResponder API
 Because the fundamental functionality of PanResponder is to determine the current 
touches happening on the user’s device, the use cases are unlimited. In my experience, 
I’ve used this API often to do things like the following:
 ¡	
¡	
¡	
Create a swipeable stack of cards where an item is removed from the stack when 
swiped out of view (think Tinder)
 Create an animatable overlay that the user can close by clicking a button or move 
out of view by swiping down
 Give the user the ability to rearrange items in a list by pressing part of a list item 
and moving to the desired location
 The use cases for PanResponder are many, but the most apparent and frequently used 
let the user move items around in the UI based on their press/swipe position.
 Let’s look at a basic gesture event using onPanResponderMove(event, gestureState), 
which gives you data about the current position of the touch event, including current posi
tion, accumulated difference between current position and original position, and more:
 onPanResponderMove(evt, gestureState) {
  console.log(evt.nativeEvent)
  console.log(gestureState)
 }
 To use this API, you first create an instance of PanResponder in the componentWill
Mount method. In this instance, you can then set all the configuration and callback 
methods for the PanResponder, using the methods to manipulate the state and View.
 Let’s look at the create method, which is the only available method for PanRe
sponder. It creates the configuration for the PanResponder instance.  Table 9.8 shows 
the configuration options available to the create method.  ",reactnativeinaction.pdf page 217,"PanResponder API is used for touch-based interactions including: creating swipeable card stacks (like Tinder), building animatable overlays that can be swiped away, and enabling drag-to-reorder functionality in lists. The API provides gesture event data including current position and accumulated differences from the original position through onPanResponderMove."
How do you perform port scanning and service identification using Nmap in penetration testing?,"Identifying open ports, services, and operating systems After performing host discovery, the next step is to identify any open ports on the targeted system and determine which services are mapped to those open ports. There are various techniques that a pen etration tester can use to identify the open ports on a targeted system. Some techniques are manual, while others can simply be automated using the Nmap tool. To get started fingerprinting using Nmap, please use the following instructions: 1. Firstly, ensure the Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2 and Metasploitable 3 (Windows version) virtual machines are powered on. 2. On Kali Linux, open the Terminal and use the following commands to perform a basic Nmap scan to determine whether any of the top 1,000 ports are open on the Metasploitable 3 (Win dows version) virtual machine: kali@kali:~$ nmap 172.30.1.48 As shown in the following screenshot, Nmap indicates there are 20 TCP open ports and provides the name of their associated services:",ultimatekalilinuxbook.pdf page 216,"After host discovery, use Nmap to identify open ports and services on target systems. A basic scan command like ""nmap [target_ip]"" checks the top 1,000 ports. Nmap reports open TCP ports and their associated services. For example, scanning Metasploitable might reveal 20 open TCP ports with service names, enabling further security assessment."
What characterizes rack-based servers in warehouse-scale computers?,"Rack-based servers
 WSC servers are typically assembled in racks with each server consuming one 1U slot. A 1U server 
slot has a front panel opening 19” wide and 1.75” high. One rack might contain as many as 40 
servers, consuming 70” of vertical space.
 Each server is a fairly complete computer system containing a moderately powerful processor, 
RAM, a local disk drive, and a 1 Gbit/sec or faster Ethernet interface. Since the capabilities and 
capacities of consumer-grade processors, DRAM, and disks are continuing to grow, we won’t 
attempt to identify the performance parameters of a specific system configuration.
 Although each server contains a processor with integrated graphics and some USB ports, most 
servers do not have a display, keyboard, or mouse directly connected, except perhaps during their 
initial configuration. Rack-mounted servers generally operate in a so-called headless mode, in 
which all interaction with the system takes place over its network connection",moderncomputerarchitectureandorganization.pdf page 354,"Rack-based servers in WSCs occupy 1U slots (19"" wide, 1.75"" high), with up to 40 servers per rack. Each server contains a processor, RAM, local disk, and 1+ Gbit/sec Ethernet. They typically run in headless mode without direct display/keyboard/mouse connections, with all interaction through network connections. This design maximizes density and operational efficiency."
What is Roslyn and how does it help developers in .NET?,"Roslyn Developers rely heavily on their tools to help their development. Just look at what Visual Studio does to help you write better code, or look at the rich ecosystem of Visual Studio extensions. IDE features like IntelliSense and Find All References need an understanding of the current code base; this is typically information that a compiler can provide. Compilers used to be black boxes that took your source code and transformed it into, in our case, intermediate language. With Roslyn, Microsoft aimed to open up the compiler platform and provide it with an API set for everyone to use to write code enhancing tools. With Roslyn, we can write analyzers and code fixes. Analyzers look at your code and notify you when you write a piece of code that is not according to what the analyzer knows. .NET even ships with a default set of Analyzers; just open a new .NET 6 project and use solution explorer to have a look at Dependencies ➤ Analyzers, as shown in Figure 10-1",introducingnet6.pdf page 275,"Roslyn is Microsoft's compiler platform that opens up the compiler as an API rather than a black box. It enables developers to write analyzers and code fixes that examine code and notify when it doesn't conform to standards. .NET ships with default analyzers, and Roslyn powers IDE features like IntelliSense and Find All References by providing compiler-level understanding of codebases."
Why should TypeScript developers use noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks?,"TypeScript is the most helpful when it has type information, so you should be sure to set noImplicitAny whenever possible. Once you grow accustomed to all variables having types, TypeScript without noImplicitAny feels almost like a different language. For new projects, you should start with noImplicitAny on, so that you write the types as you write your code. This will help TypeScript spot problems, improve the read ability of your code, and enhance your development experience (see Item 6). Leaving noImplicitAny off is only appropriate if you’re transitioning a project from Java Script to TypeScript (see Chapter 8). strictNullChecks controls whether null and undefined are permissible values in every type. This code is valid when strictNullChecks is off: const x: number = null; // OK, null is a valid number but triggers an error when you turn strictNullChecks on: const x: number = null; // ~ Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number' A similar error would have occurred had you used undefined instead of null. If you mean to allow null, you can fix the error by making your intent explicit: 8 | Chapter 1: Getting to Know TypeScript const x: number | null = null; If you do not wish to permit null, you’ll need to track down where it came from and add either a check or an assertion: const el = document.getElementById('status'); el.textContent = 'Ready'; // ~~ Object is possibly 'null' if (el) { el.textContent = 'Ready'; // OK, null has been excluded } el!.textContent = 'Ready'; // OK, we've asserted that el is non-null strictNullChecks is tremendously helpful for catching errors involving null and undefined values, but it does increase the difficulty of using the language. If you’re starting a new project, try setting strictNullChecks. But if you’re new to the lan guage or migrating a JavaScript codebase, you may elect to leave it off. You should certainly set noImplicitAny before you set strictNullChecks. If you choose to work without strictNullChecks, keep an eye out for the dreaded “undefined is not an object” runtime error. Every one of these is a reminder that you should consider enabling stricter checking. Changing this setting will only get harder as your project grows, so try not to wait too long before enabling it. There are many other settings that affect language semantics (e.g., noImplicitThis and strictFunctionTypes), but these are minor compared to noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks. To enable all of these checks, turn on the strict setting. Type Script is able to catch the most errors with strict, so this is where you eventually want to wind up. Know which options you’re using! If a coworker shares a TypeScript example and you’re unable to reproduce their errors, make sure your compiler options are the same.",effectivetypescript.pdf page 8,"noImplicitAny ensures all variables have explicit types, catching errors early and improving code readability. strictNullChecks prevents null/undefined values in types unless explicitly allowed (e.g., ""number | null""), catching ""undefined is not an object"" errors. New projects should enable both, ideally using the ""strict"" setting. They increase initial difficulty but significantly reduce runtime errors."
What are the main components of AI orchestrators in LLM-powered applications?,"The main components of AI orchestrators
 From one side, the paradigm shift of foundation models implies a great simplification in the domain 
of AI-powered applications: after producing models, now the trend is consuming models. On the other 
side, many roadblocks might arise in developing this new kind of AI, since there are LLM-related com
ponents that are brand new and have never been managed before within an application life cycle. For 
example, there might be malicious actors that could try to change the LLM instructions (the system 
message mentioned earlier) so that the application does not follow the correct instructions. This is 
an example of a new set of security threats that are typical to LLM-powered applications and need to 
be addressed with powerful counterattacks or preventive techniques.
32
 LLMs for AI-Powered Applications
 The following is an illustration of the main components of such applications:
 Figure 2.5: High-level architecture of LLM-powered applications
 Let’s inspect each of these components in detail:
 • Models: The model is simply the type of LLM we decide to embed in our application. There 
are two main categories of models:
 • Proprietary LLMs: Models that are owned by specific companies or organizations. 
Examples include GPT-3 and GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, or Bard, developed by Goo
gle. As their source code and architecture are not available, those models cannot be 
re-trained from scratch on custom data, yet they can be fine-tuned if needed.
 • Open-source: Models with code and architecture freely available and distributed, hence 
they can also be trained from scratch on custom data. Examples include Falcon LLM, 
developed by Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII), or LLaMA, developed 
by Meta.
 We will dive deeper into the main set of LLMs available today in Chapter 3, Choosing an LLM 
for Your Application.
 • Memory: LLM applications commonly use a conversational interface, which requires the 
ability to refer back to earlier information within the conversation. This is achieved through 
a “memory” system that allows the application to store and retrieve past interactions. Note 
that past interactions could also constitute additional non-parametric knowledge to be added 
to the model. To achieve that, it is important to store all the past conversations – properly 
embedded – into VectorDB, which is at the core of the application’s data.
Chapter 2
 33
 Definition
 VectorDB is a type of database that stores and retrieves information based on 
vectorized embeddings, the numerical representations that capture the meaning 
and context of text. By using VectorDB, you can perform semantic search and 
retrieval based on the similarity of meanings rather than keywords. VectorDB can 
also help LLMs generate more relevant and coherent text by providing contextual 
understanding and enriching generation results. Some examples of VectorDBs 
are Chroma,  Elasticsearch, Milvus, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, and Facebook 
AI Similarity Search (FAISS).
 FAISS, developed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2017, was one of the pioneering vector 
databases. It was designed for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense 
vectors and is particularly useful for multimedia documents and dense embed
dings. It was initially an internal research project at Facebook. Its primary goal 
was to better utilize GPUs for identifying similarities related to user preferences. 
Over time, it evolved into the fastest available library for similarity search and can 
handle billion-scale datasets. FAISS has opened up possibilities for recommenda
tion engines and AI-based assistant systems.
 • Plug-ins: They can be seen as additional modules or components that can be integrated into 
the LLM to extend its functionality or adapt it to specific tasks and applications. These plug-ins 
act as add-ons, enhancing the capabilities of the LLM beyond its core language generation or 
comprehension abilities.
 The idea behind plug-ins is to make LLMs more versatile and adaptable, allowing developers 
and users to customize the behavior of the language model for their specific needs. Plug-ins 
can be created to perform various tasks, and they can be seamlessly incorporated into the 
LLM’s architecture.
 • Prompts: This is probably the most interesting and pivotal component of an LLM-powered 
application. We’ve already quoted, in the previous section, Andrej Karpathy’s affirmation that 
“English is the hottest new programming language,” and you will understand why in the up
coming chapters. Prompts can defined at two different levels:
 • “Frontend,” or what the user sees: A “prompt” refers to the input to the model. It is the 
way the user interacts with the application, asking things in natural language.
 • “Backend,” or what the user does not see: Natural language is not only the way to interact, 
as a user, with the frontend; it is also the way we “program” the backend. In fact, on 
top of the user’s prompt, there are many natural language instructions, or meta-promts, 
that we give to the model so that it can properly address the user’s query. Meta-prompts 
are meant to instruct the model to act as it is meant to. For example, if we want to limit 
our application to answer only questions related to the documentation we provided 
in VectorDB, we will specify the following in our meta-prompts to the model: “Answer 
only if the question is related to the provided documentation.”
34
 LLMs for AI-Powered Applications
 Finally, we get to the core of the high-level architecture shown in Figure 2.5, that is, the AI orchestrator. 
With the AI orchestrator, we refer to lightweight libraries that make it easier to embed and orchestrate 
LLMs within applications.
 As LLMs went viral by the end of 2022, many libraries started arising in the market. In the next sections, 
we are going to focus on three of them: LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and Haystack",buildingllmpoweredapplications.pdf page 31,"AI orchestrators are lightweight libraries (like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and Haystack) that embed and orchestrate LLMs within applications. They manage prompts at two levels: frontend (user-facing queries) and backend (meta-prompts with instructions). They handle security threats, vector databases for documentation, and coordinate between LLM components to properly address user queries while following specified constraints."
Explain activation functions in neural networks and their purpose.," Activation functions: adding some extra nonlinearity
 g
 Activation or transfer functions are one such class of functions, and are commonly
 used in deep learning (DL). The implicit activation function in linear regression is, of
 course, linear (see Figure A-8). But there are several more interesting alternatives that
 have become essential for practitioners. In the rectified linear unit (ReLU) case, out
put is zero when α0 + α1X1 + α2X2 is negative or zero, and for positive values we are
 again in the world of linear regression. Notice how the function gets activated only
 when the joint effort is positive, hence its name. A smoother version is the sigmoid
 activation. Activation functions are another way to include nonlinear effects in a pre
dictive model. They were first introduced to capture our understanding of how neu
rons in our brain fire, but today we use them because they improve the predictive
 power of our models.
 8 In some cases we can still use linear regression, say gz = expz . Using the logarithm transformation takes us
 back to the linear realm with a new, transformed outcome 
ln y

Figure A-8. Different transfer or activation functions
 With these tools we are ready to introduce neural networks. A neural network is a set
 of nodes and edges or connections between the nodes like the one depicted in
 Figure A-9. The left panel shows a network with only two inputs, each of which
 affects two hidden or intermediate nodes, the strength mediated by the correspond
ing parameters. We may decide to use nonlinear activation functions in each of the
 intermediate nodes. Finally, once we have the strength of each hidden unit we are
 ready to aggregate the impact onto the output, mediated again by corresponding
 weights and possibly an activation function. It may not be immediately obvious, but
 these arrangements of nodes and edges were originally designed to emulate how our
 brains work, nodes being the neurons that are connected through synapses or edges
 in the network. These days, few practitioners take this analogy literally. The right
 panel shows a somewhat deeper network with two hidden layers, each one with dif
ferent widths or number of nodes. It is fully connected since every node in a layer is
 connected to nodes in the subsequent layer, but this need not be the case. As a matter
 of fact, one way to control for overfitting in DL is by systematically deleting some of
 these edges between nodes, a technique known as dropout.",analyticalskillsforaianddatascience.pdf page 205,"Activation functions add nonlinearity to neural networks. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) outputs zero for negative inputs and linear for positive values. Sigmoid provides smoother activation. These functions were originally designed to emulate neuron firing but are now used to improve predictive model performance. They enable networks to learn complex, non-linear relationships in data."
How does Bayesian Optimization work for black box function optimization?,"At this point, you might be wondering whether all of this heavy machinery really
 works—or works better than some simple strategy like random sampling. To find out,
 let’s take a look at a “demo” of BayesOpt on a simple function. This will also be a good
 way for us to move away from the abstract to the concrete and tease out what we are
 able to do in future chapters.
 Let’s say the black box objective function we are trying to optimize (specifically, in
 this case, maximize) is the one-dimensional function in figure 1.6, defined from –5
 to 5. Again, this picture is only for our reference; in black box optimization, we, in
 fact, do not know the shape of the objective. We see the objective has a couple of local
 maxima around –5 (roughly, –2.4 and 1.5) but the global maximum is on the right at
 approximately 4.3. Let’s also assume we are allowed to evaluate the objective function
 a maximum of 10 times.",bayesianoptimizationinaction page 14,"Bayesian Optimization (BayesOpt) maximizes/minimizes black box objective functions with limited evaluations. It works without knowing the function shape, using probabilistic models to intelligently select evaluation points. For example, when optimizing a 1D function from -5 to 5 with 10 evaluations, BayesOpt can find the global maximum (around 4.3) while avoiding local maxima, outperforming random sampling strategies."
What's the best way to make a proper cup of tea?,,,"Right, here's the thing - use freshly boiled water (not reboiled), warm the pot first, add one teaspoon of loose leaf tea per person plus one for the pot. Let it brew for 3-5 minutes depending on strength preference. Milk goes in after if you're having it. The key is not rushing it and using decent quality tea leaves."
How can I improve my sleep quality?,,,"Good sleep comes down to consistency and environment. Try to keep the same sleep schedule even on weekends. Make your room properly dark and cool (around 16-18°C is ideal). Avoid screens for an hour before bed, and don't have caffeine after 2pm. Regular exercise helps too, just not right before bed. If you're still struggling after a few weeks of this, might be worth chatting to your GP."
What are some good ways to stay motivated when learning something new?,,,"Learning something new can be a bit of a slog at times. Break it down into smaller, manageable chunks rather than trying to tackle everything at once. Set specific goals and track your progress - it's quite satisfying to see how far you've come. Mix up your learning methods to keep things interesting, and don't be afraid to take breaks when you need them. Also, find a community or someone else learning the same thing - it helps to share the struggle and celebrate the wins together."
What should I consider when planning a hiking trip?,,,"Start with choosing a route that matches your fitness level - don't bite off more than you can chew. Check the weather forecast and terrain difficulty beforehand. Pack the essentials: proper boots, waterproofs, map and compass (don't just rely on your phone), first aid kit, enough water and food. Tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back. Start early to give yourself plenty of daylight, and always have a backup plan if conditions deteriorate."
How do I negotiate a better salary at work?,,,"Do your homework first - research what others in similar roles are earning in your area. Document your achievements and the value you've added to the company. Pick the right time, ideally during a performance review or after completing a major project. Be confident but not aggressive, and have a specific figure in mind rather than a vague request. If they can't meet your salary expectations, consider negotiating for other benefits like flexible working, additional holiday, or professional development opportunities. And remember, the worst they can say is no."
